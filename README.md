Creating an Analogue guitar pedal 

This project is about building an analogue guitar pedal, this is a device controlled by the guitarist's feet to change the sound of the guitar. In simple terms, a guitar pedal takes in the guitar signal as an input, applies a specified effect to the signal and this becomes the output. 

Objectives of the project:
•	Investigate common guitar effects pedals.
•	Breakdown pedal effects into categories and identify a suitable effect to implement. 
•	Thoroughly investigate the underlying mechanism which produces the chosen effect.
•	Determine system input and output parameters 
•	Derive design equations for the filter.
•	Use simulation software to validate the design parameters. 
•	Analyse filter e.g. frequency and phase responses, poles & zeros via MATLAB & PSpice.
•	Implement the software-validated design on a breadboard for hardware verification. 
•	Build onto a prototyping board, attach audio jacks for input and output connections.
